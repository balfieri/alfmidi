AlfMidi is a self-contained Python module that can translate code snippets into MIDI files.

See comments in AlfMidi.py for available methods.  There are low-level methods and higher-level methods.

We're just getting started.  Lots of crazy ideas will be implemented, including brain-to-computer
interface.  

What follows are some self-contained examples.  You can cut and paste each of these
into a file then run python3 on that file.  Then import the .mid file into your DAW for playback.
